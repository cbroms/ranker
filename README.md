# Ranker

Ranking stuff.

The client is built with Sapper (svelte.js) and the backend is a Polka (node.js) server.

You can run both the client and server in development mode with docker:

```
docker-compose up
```

Changes made the the source of either the client or server will be hot reloaded in their respective docker containers.
